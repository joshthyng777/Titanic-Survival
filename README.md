# Titanic Survival Rates Model

## Overview
This repository contains a machine learning model that predicts survival rates of passengers on the Titanic using a `randomForestClassifier`. The model is trained on two datasets: `train.csv` and `test.csv`, which are provided as input data. The predictions made by the model are stored in a CSV file named `submissions.csv`.

## Dependencies
The following libraries are required to run the code in this repository:
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is based on the famous Titanic dataset, which contains information about passengers on the Titanic, including features such as age, gender, class, fare, and whether or not they survived. The dataset is divided into two parts: `train.csv` and `test.csv`. The `train.csv` dataset is used for training the model, while the `test.csv` dataset is used for making predictions.

## Model
The model used in this project is a `randomForestClassifier`, which is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision tree classifiers to make predictions. The `randomForestClassifier` is known for its ability to handle missing values and noisy data, which makes it suitable for this project.

## Code
The code for this project is written in Python and uses popular machine learning libraries such as pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn. The main steps of the code include:

1. Importing the necessary libraries and loading the `train.csv` and `test.csv` datasets using pandas.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the data and handle missing values, outliers, and other data preprocessing steps.
3. Feature engineering to extract relevant information from the data and create new features if needed.
4. Splitting the data into training and testing sets for model training and evaluation.
5. Training the `randomForestClassifier` model on the training data.
6. Evaluating the model performance using appropriate evaluation metrics.
7. Making predictions on the `test.csv` dataset using the trained model.
8. Saving the predictions in a CSV file named `submissions.csv` for submission.

## Conclusion
The Titanic survival rates model implemented in this repository using a `randomForestClassifier` and two datasets `train.csv` and `test.csv` is a powerful tool for predicting the survival rates of passengers on the Titanic. The code is written in Python and utilizes popular machine learning libraries. The trained model can be used for making predictions on new data and can be further improved with additional feature engineering and model tuning techniques.
